i try to figure out how animals spawn. here i found a article about it https://forums.dayz.com/topic/246623-wolf-spawn-xml/

- water means they can activate randomly and without player presence
- rest means that the wolf spawn is activated by players in the zone
- hunting grounds are the area on influence (activation areas) other than the previous two.  
- so each area of a wolf spawn has 4 - 5 water /rest spawns with another 4-6 hunting grounds.
